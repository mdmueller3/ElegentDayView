## Usage

EDV operates in either editing or display mode. In editing mode, the user can interact and create new events by long pressing on the screen. [Here's a little gif of editing mode](https://gfycat.com/SelfishCorruptGuillemot).

- To create events, hold down and drag to specify when the event occurs. After you are done specifying the timeframe, you'll be able to enter the name of the event or delete the event.
- To edit events, simply tap on them.

Display mode is simply for showing the events during the day.

## TODO
- Still a few bugs when creating events that I need to work out
- ElegantDayView may not look so elegant on screens other than iPhone 6
- More customization
